This request sought information about €100,000 in funding from the Department of Health to the HSE to build out a harm reduction campaign. (Mentioned in one of the drafts in the foi-social-media folder)

The FOI Unit contacted me and discussed administrative access options which I accepted.


Part of the request:

"
If it clarifies further - I'm looking for a break down of the different harm reduction programmes the funding was spent on.

In a briefing for Minister Feighan, they indicate the HSE was given €100,000 in 2020 to develop a harm reduction campaign. So I hoped the FOI would cover the spending of the funds, and any information about how the programmes were selected.

I'll include a quote from the briefing below, but it's available online at this link https://github.com/afk11/foi/tree/master/foi-social-media in the document titled "2. Draft 1 Briefing for Minister Frank Feighan.docx"

Quoted:
    • The Department of Health, as part of the introduction of the Health Diversion Programme, is providing €100,000 in 2020 to develop a national harm reduction campaign to raise awareness of the risks associated with drug use.
    • The HSE has conducted market research on how to best tailor its communications towards the public so as to increase the efficacy of its harm reduction information. Through this the HSE has identified a need to create new drug education resources for the general public, the development of which will begin in Q4 2020.
